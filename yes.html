        <p>My dearest Bebby,</p>
        Hey Bebby,

        I’ve been thinking about this moment for so long, and I still can’t find the perfect words to explain just how much you mean to me. But here goes:
        
        The day you said “yes” to me... it wasn’t just a word. It was the start of something incredible, something I never thought I’d be lucky enough to have. I’ve been imagining the life we’ll share each and every little thing that’s ahead of us. And I can’t wait to make those dreams come true with you.
        
        You, me, us there’s nothing I want more than to build a future together. I see us in a cozy home, surrounded by love, laughter, and of course, Ming, Eros, Chanel, Gucci, Jimmy, Rui, Zhi with a bunch of little fur siblings. I picture us traveling the world, hand in hand, creating memories we'll cherish forever. But most of all, I can’t wait to make you my forever.
        
        I want you to know that this moment, this decision, is everything to me. You’ve made me the happiest person alive. And every day, I’ll keep proving to you how much you mean to me.
        
        So, here we are, at the start of our forever. Let’s take this journey together. And when I say “I love you,” I mean it more than you’ll ever know.
        
        <p>Let’s do this. 💍❤️</p>
        
        With all my love,
